## Dice game ðŸŽ®ðŸ•¹

We will be making a simple game!

The dice game is a two player game. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

> There is a flowchart of how the game should function in the folder for you to understand the flow.


The starter folder has the beginning code of the design of the game but not javascript functionality, we will be doing that together!ðŸ˜Š
